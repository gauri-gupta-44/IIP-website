            themselves can be able to develop projects and launch them LIVE on
            IIP Academy Online Servers. Our Students had developed several
            projects like wscubetech.com. Many students get easy job placements
            due to their online Projects on the IIP Academy. We are only
            institute in Jodhpur which provides free Web Hosting to our students

            <br />
            Engineering and MCA students can develop any small minor projects in
            .NET or PHP and could extend as their Major Projects in further
            years. Minor Projects are really not hard to develop, as also the
            colleges generally are not strict in accepting the minor projects.
            <br />
            Minor Projects can be small but it must be remarkable. Because
            details of Minor Projects are required to put in your Resume. And
            students with good minor projects can be easily placed in good
            companies during Campus Placements.
